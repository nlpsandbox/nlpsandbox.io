## Overview

Synapse is a collaborative platform for researchers and developers. Synapse is
developed by Sage Bionetworks to offer services that support:

- Organization of digital research assets (e.g., files, SQL tables, Docker
  images)
- Recording provenance to give researchers credits for their work
- Collaboration among researchers

The NLP Sandbox walk in the footsteps of previous successful scientific
challenges that been organized using Synapse. The NLP Sandbox relies on the
following features of Synapse to enable its users to develop and benchmark new
NLP Tools.

- Creation and management of Teams
- Unlimited storage of private Docker images
- Benchmark the performance of NLP Tools on public and private datasets

The sections below describe how to setup your development environment on Synapse
so you can start developing and benchmarking your next NLP tool.

## Create a Synapse account

If you don't have already an account, visit the home page of [synapse.org] and
register. Make sure to complete your profile information.

## Get Certified

You need to certify your Synapse account if you want to perform the following

## Create a Synapse Team

Playing -- huh -- working together will make your experience developing and
benchmarking NLP tools more enjoyable. Also, at the time of submitting a tool
for evaluation, Synapse will ask you if the submission is made on behalf of a
User or a Team. Submitting as a Team offers more flexibility if you decide to
invite team members to work with you in the future.
