###NLP Sandbox Synapse Discussion Forum
While the Discord server is our preferred way to connect with the NLP Sandbox Team and community, we also provide a [Synapse Discussion Forum](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn22277123/discussion/default)  for questions related to submissions and Synapse.

With the exception of sensitive topics, we request that all questions are to be posed on the NLP Sandbox Discord server or Synapse Discussion Forum rather than through private discussion. We cannot guarantee that emails directly sent to members of the Organizers team will be given priority in getting answered.

> **Communication Policy **
> Informal language is encouraged in the forums, but remember that everything you say is public. Please be courteous and avoid using disrespectful language -- we want to keep the forums a place of positive support for everyone.
>
> Additionally, please give the NLP Sandbox Team time to respond. We will do our best in responding to all questions posted between Monday 9AM to Friday 5PM Pacific Time within 24 hours, whereas questions posted outside of the business week (including holidays), will be answered on the following business day.
