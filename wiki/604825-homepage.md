<!-- <font size=4>**Value statement**</font>

The widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has enabled secondary use of EHR data for clinical research and healthcare delivery. As much of the detailed patient information is recorded in clinical narratives, unlocking information from unstructured notes and integrating such information with structured EHR data has become critical for EHR-based studies. Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in clinical narratives presents a barrier in conducting EHR-based biomedical research and sharing the data across sites.

<font size=4>**Goal**</font>

The goal of this project is to create a cloud-based environment that enables systematic and continuous benchmarking of NLP tools to solve specific tasks. The first NLP task targeted is the annotation of PHI in different types of clinical notes; however the sandbox environment is designed to support any NLP tasks (e.g., medication intake, obesity status detection, heart disease risk factor detection). This environment adopts the model-to-data approach [developed by Sage Bionetworks and DREAM](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4128)  to enable the evaluation of submissions on private datasets hosted by different sites. A draft of the architecture of the NLP Sandbox is available at https://bit.ly/cd2h-nlp-sandbox.

<font size=4>**Motivation**</font>

- Create a cloud-based environment that brings the following stakeholders together: Developers, Users, and Data Providers.
- Submit an NLP tool once and have it evaluated on public and private datasets hosted by different sites.
- Engage the community in creating standard schemas, API specifications, and dataset annotation protocols for NLP tools and Data Nodes, leverage past efforts and expertise from NLP experts (Mayo Clinic, MCW, UW, N3C).
- Promote the development of modular, reusable, and interchangeable NLP tools.
