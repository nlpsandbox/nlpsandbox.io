## Benchmarking NLP Sandbox Tools

NLP Sandbox is an open platform for benchmarking modular natural language processing (NLP) tools on both public and private datasets. Academics, students, and industry professionals are invited to [browse the available tasks] and [participate by developing and submitting an NLP Sandbox tool].

### PHI Annotation & De-Identification

The first series of NLP Sandbox tasks supported by the NLP Sandbox are the annotation and de-identification of Protected Health Information (PHI) in clinical notes. This first series of tasks have been identified through our collaboration with the [National Center for Date to Health (CD2H)].

### Benchmark NLP Tools on Private Data

The NLP Sandbox adopts the [model-to-data approach] to enable NLP developers to assess the performance of their tools on public and private datasets. When a developer submits a tool, partner organizations (e.g. hospitals, universities) automatically download the tool and evaluate its performance against their private data in a secure environment. Upon successfully completion, the performance of the tool is returned by the partner organization and automatically published in the [leaderboards].

### Access Production-Ready Tools

The NLP Sandbox aims to accelerate the deployment of tools to production environments via the promotion of best-coding practices and the adoption of modern tool development technologies. A core principle of the NLP Sandbox is that the tools deployed in production environments have been benchmarked "as-is". Moreover, the NLP Sandbox [leaderboards] helps users to identify the best-performing tool submitted to a given NLP Sandbox task.

### Register a Partner Organization

Is your organization interested in evaluating the performance of one or more types of NLP Sandbox tools on its private data in a secure environment? Please let us know! In addition to supporting the biomedical NLP community, the NLP Sandbox will enable your organization to identify the tools that work best on its own data.

### Featured NLP Sandbox Tool

The [NLP Sandbox PHI Deidentifier] depends on an instance of the NLP Sandbox Date Annotator, NLP Sandbox Person Name Annotator and NLP Sandbox Physical Address Annotator to de-identify protected health information (PHI) from clinical notes. The performance of the PHI Deidentifier improves as more performant annotators are benchmarked on [NLPSandbox.io].
