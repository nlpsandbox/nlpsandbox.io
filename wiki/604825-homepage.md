## Benchmarking NLP Tools

The NLP Sandbox provides a common development model for building NLP Tools and benchmarking their performance on public and private datasets.

### PHI Annotation & De-Identification

The first series of NLP Tasks targeted by the NLP Sandbox are the annotation and de-identification of Protected Health Information (PHI) in clinical notes. This first series of tasks have been identified through our collaboration with the first NLP Sandbox Driver, the [National Center for Date to Health (CD2H)].

See the [Tasks section] for more information on the NLP Sandbox tasks and philosophy, and get start with the development of your first NLP Tool!

### Benchmark your Tool on Private Datasets

The NLP Sandbox adopts the [model-to-data approach] to enable NLP Developers to assess the performance of their tools on private datasets. When developers make a submission, the submitted NLP Tool is automatically pulled by multiple Data Hosting Sites (e.g. hospitals, universities) who evaluate the performance of the tool against their dataset. This operation is performed in a secured environment deployed and fully controlled by the data provider. The Data Hosting Sites then return the performance of the tool, which is then published in [Leaderboards].

### Register a new Data Hosting Site

Is your organization interested in registered a Data Hosting Site for an existing or new NLP Task? Please let us know! In addition to supporting the [nlpsandbox.io] community, the NLP Sandbox will enable your organization to identify the NLP Tools that work best on its own data.
