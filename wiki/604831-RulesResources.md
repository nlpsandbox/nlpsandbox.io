## **General Information on DREAM Challenges**
A complete description of the DREAM Challenge approach and links to other DREAM Challenges can be found on the [**DREAM Challenge site**](http://dreamchallenges.org).

## **Challenge Community Forum**
The Discussion forum will be the primary means of informal discussion, Q&A, and other interactions between the Challenge members (organizers, participants, etc).  We encourage participants to visit the [**Discussion**](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn22277124/discussion/default) tab frequently. If you prefer, you can also receive email notifications for every new thread by clicking the **Follow** button (_highly recommended_, as updates about the Challenge will be posted here):

<br/>

With the exception of sensitive topics, we **request that all Challenge-related questions be posed here rather than through private discussion**.  We cannot guarantee that emails directly sent to members of the Organizers team will be given priority in getting answered.

> ####! Communication Policy
> Informal language is encouraged in the forums, but remember that everything you say is public.  Please be courteous and avoid using disrespectful language -- we want to keep the forums a place of positive support for everyone.  
>
> Additionally, please give the Organizers team time to respond.  We will do our best in responding to all questions posted between Monday 9AM to Friday 5PM Pacific Time within 24 hours, whereas questions posted outside of the business week (including holidays), will be answered on the following business day.
