## **Step 4. Prepare a Submission**

For a participant to be eligible as a consortium-level author, there are two parts to the challenge submission: 
1.  An executable Docker container that contains the participant's model or a prediction file.   View [**File Submission**](#!Synapse:syn22277124/wiki/604835) and [**Docker Submission**](#!Synapse:syn22277124/wiki/604834).
1.  A **public** Synapse Project that contains a writeup of their methods and source code.  For most Challenges, this will be submitted after the final submissions. View [**Writeup Submission**](#!Synapse:syn22277124/wiki/604839).
1.  All submissions are due at 5PM Pacific Time of the deadline date.

> If your submission will include files you need to upload to Synapse, you must be a [**Certified User**](https://docs.synapse.org/articles/accounts_certified_users_and_profile_validation.html#certified-users).

## **Step 5. Submission**
1. Make sure to indicate whether you are submitting as an individual or a team. If submitting as a team, identify the team. **Once you have submitted as a Team, you may not submit as an individual and vice versa.**
1. For the writeup submission, **AFTER** your final challenge submission, please share your private project with the `public`  with `Can Download` permissions. Read more [**here**](https://docs.synapse.org/articles/access_controls.html#how-to-share-projects) about how to share things in Synapse.

${evalsubmit?projectId=syn22277124&unavailableMessage=Please register to make a submission.&buttonText=Submit to the challenge}

After you submit, expect an email either indicating that your submission was submitted successfully or that your entry is considered invalid because of specific problems with your entry. If there is any problem with your submitted entry, a description of the problems (e.g. missing items) will be sent to you. Use this information to modify and resubmit your entry. These emails will be sent to the email address saved in your Synapse profile -- if you have not changed it, it will be the same email you used during registration. If you do not receive this email, check your spam folder or your notification settings.


## **Step 6. Share Ideas and Ask Questions**
The [**Discussion Forum**](#!Synapse:syn22277124/discussion/default) should be used for:
* Any and all questions about the Challenge 
* Collaboration with other participants
