### **Late submissions are generally not accepted, so if you have never submitted to a Challenge before, please make sure to SUBMIT EARLY so that you can understand and get familiar with the submission system.**

Here are some scenarios where late submissions **may** be allowed:

* If you have already made a submission (either as a user or as a team), and just by honest mistake, submitted the **exact same** predictions file/Docker image instead of a new one. In such events, participants are requested to inform the Organizers as soon as possible. Submissions for which the score has already been returned to you cannot be cancelled.

* If you are part of a team and have been making team submissions, but mistakenly submitted as an individual at the last-minute.  If this occurs, contact the Organizers as soon as possible. The rectification will be to invalidate the submission as an individual participant, to which after you can submit as a team.

Here are some scenarios where late submissions are **absolutely not** allowed:

* From past experience, many participants make one last submission shortly before the end of a round or Challenge. Due to this, there may be a buildup of submissions depending on the compute resources available to the Challenge. As long as the submission is submitted prior to the deadline, the submission will be evaluated. That being said, you may not receive feedback from the submission until after your submission starts to run, which may happen after the submission deadline. If the submission fails due to a participantâ€™s mistake, the Challenge Organizers will NOT accept the participant to make a new submission.

* Forgetting about a deadline

#### **Note that submissions are due the day of the deadline at 5PM Pacific Time** (unless otherwise noted).

Once you have submitted your predictions file or Docker image, you should receive the following email:

> **Submission Processing Started ....**
> This is the first email you will receive when your submission begins to process.  Often times, the system can only handle so many submissions at one time, so there may be a wait time (up to 6 hours).  You will also receive a hyperlink that will take you to your submission logs, which will be available shortly after you receive this email.

If you do not receive this email in a timely manner, please check your spam folder and notification settings in Synapse. If your settings are configured correctly, please head to the Discussion forum to ask a Challenge Organizer about the status of your submission.

Some follow-up emails can also be expected, such as:

**Successful Submissions**
> **Submission to ... scored!**
> The prediction file created from your model is valid and, as a result, has been scored. Depending on the Challenge and/or current phase of the Challenge, the score(s) may be included in this email.

> **Workflow Completed**
> If you receive this email, it means your submission has been scored and is now in the "ACCEPTED" state, that is, it will be included in the running leaderboard.

**Unsuccessful Submissions**
> **Submission to ... invalid!**
> The prediction file created from your model is invalid, which could be due to formatting issues, missing prediction rows/columns, incorrect names, etc.  Often times, reasons for the invalid submission will be included in this email, however, some Challenges may not return any logs at all (either due to sensitive data or other reasons).

> **Workflow Failed**
> If you receive this email, it means your submission could not run to completion or it did not generate a prediction file with the expected filename(s).  The submission will not be included in the running leaderboard.
