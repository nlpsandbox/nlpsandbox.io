### NLP Sandbox Rules

#### Registering for NLP Sandbox

- You may only register once for the NLP Sandbox.
- After you register individually, you may work alone or on one Team with other NLP Sandbox users. All Teams must designate a Team Manager, and each Team Member must be a registered participant in the NLP Sandbox. It is up to each Team to organize its submissions and to follow the NLP Sandbox submission requirements.
- Before using external data, participants should consult the NLP Sandbox website for any limitations and any additional Data Access Terms of Use affiliated with the NLP Sandbox to verify that their use of a particular external data set is permitted.
- All Submissions must be formatted as specified on the particular NLP Sandbox website.
- Play by the rules. Suspected cheaters or those acting against the spirit of the NLP Sandbox will be disqualified from using this service

#### Publication Considerations

- If you are publishing your performance based on data from the Medical College of Wisconsin dataset, please cite the following:

> The project described was in part supported by the Medical College of Wisconsin and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Award Number UL1TR001436. The content is solely the responsibility of the author(s) and does not necessarily represent the official views of the NIH.

- When applicable, publication authorship byline(s) will be awarded to the top-performing Team(s) in good standing. The NLP Sandbox Team reserves the right to organize the publication authorship and contribution list in its sole discretion.
- You are free to publish the results of your method and your Team ranking at any time. However, participants agree to share the manuscript with the NLP Sandbox Team who will review it within 2 weeks and verify that it doesn’t report overall project results or any analysis of the overall results as these are parts of the main NLP Sandbox Publication. These restrictions will be lifted once the NLP Sandbox Publication is online or in print.

#### Service Agreement

- When you make a submission to the NLP Sandbox site, you agree to grant Sage Bionetworks a perpetual, royalty-free license to share your submission with our project partners.
- The NLP Sandbox Team/Sage Bionetworks make no claims to ownership of Submissions or any intellectual property that they may contain. By selecting a tool license different from “None”, you grant the NLP Sandbox Team/Sage Bionetworks and any registered NLP Sandbox Users the right to use your qualified submissions according to the terms of the license you have selected. Independently of the tool license selected, you grant the NLP Sandbox Team/Sage Bionetworks the right to analyze and publish publicly the performance of your tool.
- The NLP Sandbox/Sage Bionetworks makes no representations or warranties as to confidentiality.
- By participating you are making representations to your submission's accuracy, proprietary, noninfringement, and legal compliance, and you are agreeing to indemnify the NLP Sandbox Team/Sage Bionetworks and various other parties from liability arising out of your participation in the NLP Sandbox.
- You are agreeing to a dispute resolution process and binding arbitration for any disputes, waiving rights to pursue damages via court.
- All decisions of the NLP Sandbox Team/Sage Bionetworks, including eligibility, judging and attribution, will be final and binding on all matters relating to the NLP Sandbox.
